# Template Method Pattern (non-inheritance version)
## Example description
This simple demo of the pattern consists of an algorithm that makes caffeine based beverages (Tea & Coffee).

## Definition
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclass.
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
